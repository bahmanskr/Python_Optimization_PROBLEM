# Python_Optimization_PROBLEM

## Nuanced Navigation

The problem requires designing an optimal cyclic route for a sailing vessel to visit 12 sites while considering navigation and speed constraints. The vessel cannot sail directly against the northward wind, restricting south-to-north movement. The speed decreases based on the number of passengers, starting with 10 passengers, an additional 10 board at each site, with no disembarkation. The objective is to determine the fastest possible route that visits all sites once while adhering to these constraints.
